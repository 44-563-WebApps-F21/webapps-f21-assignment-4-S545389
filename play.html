  <h3>ACT II_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace</h3>
  <p>
      <p1><h6>PRINCE PETRO</h6>. So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p1>
<br>

<p2><h6>PAUL</h6> . Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p2>
<br>

<p3><h6>PRINCE PETRO</h6>. Naturally; you are always speaking.<br></p3>
<br>

<p4><h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6>. No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p4>
<br>

<p5><h6>R. Still</h6> , anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p5>
<br>

<p6><h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6>. My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.<p>(_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p>Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p6>
<br>

<p7><h6>CZARE</h6>.<p>(_slowly, after a pause_)</p>. I want change of air.</p7>
<br>

<p8><h6>PRINCE PAUL </h6><p>(_smiling_)</p>. A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.</p8>
<br>

<p9><h6>CZARE</h6>.<p>(_bitterly_)</p>. My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p9>
