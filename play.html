  <h3>ACT II_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace</h3>
  <p>PRINCE PETRO. So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.<br>

PRINCE PAUL. Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.<br>

PRINCE PETRO. Naturally; you are always speaking.<br>

PRINCE PAUL. No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.<br>

COUNT R. Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.<br>

PRINCE PAUL. My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place. (_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._) Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.<br>

CZARE. (_slowly, after a pause_). I want change of air.<br>

PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.<br>

CZARE. (_bitterly_). My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.<br>

PRINCE PAUL. When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.<br>

CZARE. Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
whatever you may know of a bad life.<br>

PRINCE PAUL (_shrugging his shoulders_). Experience, the name men give
to their mistakes. I never commit any.<br>

CZARE. (_bitterly_). No; crimes are more in your line.<br>

PRINCE PETRO. (_to the CZAREVITCH_). The Emperor was a good deal
agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.<br>

[1]COUNT R. (_laughing_). I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken
into the palace and carried you off.<br>
