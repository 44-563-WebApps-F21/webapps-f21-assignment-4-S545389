      <p1 class="speech">So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p1>
<br>

<h6 class="name PAUL">PAUL.</h6>
 <p2 class="speech">Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p2>
<br>

<h6 class="name PRINCE PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h6> 
<p3 class="speech">Naturally; you are always speaking.<br></p3>
<br>

<h6 class="name PRINCE PAUL">PRINCE PAUL.</h6> 
<p4 class="speech">No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p4>
<br>

<h6 class="name R.Still">R. Still,</h6>  
<p5 class="speech">anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p5>
<br>

<h6 class="name PRINCE PAUL">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p6 class="speech"> My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
    world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
    to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place<p7 class="stage-direction">(_Enter theCZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._
</p7>Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p6>

<p9 class="speech"> I want change of air.</p9>
<br>

<h6 class="name PRINCE PAUL">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p10 class="stage-direction">(_smiling_).</p10> 
<p11 class="speech">A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.</p11>
<br>

<h6 class="name CZARE">CZARE.</h6>
<p12 class="stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p12> 
<p13 class="speech">My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p13>
